# GiphyAllTheTime

Live site - https://robynocraig.github.io/GiphyAllTheTime/index.html

Click on a button to display 10 animated Giphy images from that artist. The images will be still when first loaded and clicking on them will start the animation. There is also a search button - type in an artist, hit the Submit button and the new artist's button will load after the originals. I also added a random giphy button which does exactly that - it's random!
