# GiphyAllTheTime

## What this does:
This app displays animated GIFs by artist, pulling from Giphy.

## How the code works:
The app uses AJAX to call the Giphy API, along with JavaScript and jQuery to display the HTML content. The styling was done with Bootstrap and standard CSS.

## How to run the app/deployed version:
https://robynocraig.github.io/GiphyAllTheTime/index.html
- Click on a button to display 10 animated Giphy images from that artist.
- The images will be still when first loaded and clicking on them will start the animation.
- There is also a search button - type in an artist, hit the Submit button and the new artist's button will load after the originals.
